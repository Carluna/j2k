# Evaluation of the J200 Loire gorundwater component

[Here](https://carluna.github.io/j2k/) you can find the interim results of my evaluation during my internship at INRAE! The website was created with Quarto and the only purpose is to present the results, not explain them.

In `template/` there is the skeleton to create a website in the same style. `template/index.qmd` is the main page, which also needs to be rendered to create the whole website. `template/images/` contains the INRAE logos and a favicon in the INRAE style created with [this tool](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). `template/i_section.qmd` are the i-sections of the website, which are included in `template/_quarto.yml`. The styles, which set for example the title background color and insert the logo, are defined in `template/style.css`.
